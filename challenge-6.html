/*

This array is the output of a database table, every row has the following columns: Name, ID, ParentID
so that if the Parent ID column has a value, that person is the son of the parent. 
For example:
in data[1] the parentID of Greg is "1", which is the ID of John in row 0. Note that the ID's do not always match the row numbers. 

The task is to create a tree layout representation of all the people in this table, and indent them according to the parent.
So that it will be visibly clear who is the son of who, for example:

John
	-> Greg
