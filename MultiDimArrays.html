/*

PART I - Multi dimensional Arrays

1. create a new array called grades. This will be a multi-dimensional array of the structure of:

  grades[STUDENT][SUBJECT] = grade;
  
2. use the math function random() to assign to each student a grade for each subject. 

3. output the grades array, you should have something like this in the console
[Robert: Array[0]]
      Robert: Array[0]
        Baking:70
        Math:80

4. display the information cleanly as:

Student name
  Ancient Greek: 80
  Math: 45
  
and so on.... 



PART II - add some math

5. add another value to the grades array per student, this will be the avarage. 

grades[STUDENT][AVG] = 0;

6. For each student calcualte the mean (avarage) of all his/hers grades, and put the value in the ["AVG"] 

7. Add that information to the display, so that:

STUDENT NAME
  Ancient Greek: 80
  ........
  Avarage Grade: 65
