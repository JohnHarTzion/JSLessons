/*

1. based on the code above, create functions that perform a + b (adding), a - b (substracting), a / b (dividing) on two input numbers.

2. call each of these functions with 2 input numbers and output their values. 

3. the code above solves the following math problem:
   ( x in the power of 2) in the power of 3 = x in the power of 2*3
   x in the power of 6
   
   As is shown in this page (look at the second 'simplify' example):
   http://www.purplemath.com/modules/exponent.htm
   
   create a function called doublePower that receives 3 arguments. the base number, the first power and the second power. 
   move the code above to that function so that you can call it for any 3 numbers. 
   
   call this function a few times with different nubmers, for example:
   x = 2
   first power = 2 
   second power =2 
   result will be 16
   
4. create a new function that will solve the first simply example in this page: http://www.purplemath.com/modules/exponent.htm
   
   (x in the power of 2) * (x in the power of 3) = x in the power of 5
   
   use your own function to add two numbers when you code this function. (meaning, don't just do a + b, use the function you created in part 1)
