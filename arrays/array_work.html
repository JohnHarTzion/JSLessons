/*

1. create a function that will take an array as an argument, and return an new array that has only the numbers from the given
array. 

2. run this function for each of the given arrays and create new arrays that have just the numbers. then sort the results. 

3. create a function that will take an array as an argument, and return a new array that has only the string values. 

4. create a function that will take str1 and convert it to an array - split the values on the comma. 

5. create a function that will take 2 arguments, 2 arrays, and return only the values that appear in both arrays. 
use it to find which values appar in str1 and in the arrays above.  

6. create a function that will return an associative array, the key will be the words from arr1,arr2, and arr3, as well as from 
str1 - and the value will be the count of how many times this word appears. so that:

result["egg"] = 2;
