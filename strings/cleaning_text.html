/*

The variable html has some html...
Write your own little parser, it will go through this html snippet and break each p tag to its own line, and make an array with these lines of the poem. 
Remove any html code from those lines so you have just the text in the array. 
for example:

lines[0] = 'Let me not to the marriage of true minds';
